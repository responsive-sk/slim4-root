# TODO: Engaging Laminas and Cycle ORM Communities

This document contains a plan for engaging the Laminas and Cycle ORM communities with the `responsive-sk/slim4-root` project.

## Step 1: Extend Documentation (1-2 days)

- [ ] Create specific use-cases for Laminas:
  - [ ] Integration with Laminas MVC
  - [ ] Integration with Mezzio (formerly Zend Expressive)
  - [ ] Managing paths to modules, view scripts, and configuration files

- [ ] Create specific use-cases for Cycle ORM:
  - [ ] Managing paths to schemas
  - [ ] Managing paths to migrations
  - [ ] Managing paths to models and repositories

- [ ] Update main documentation with links to new use-cases

## Step 2: Create GitHub Issues (1 day)

- [ ] Create "Integration with Laminas Framework" issue:
  - [ ] Describe integration goals
  - [ ] Share code examples
  - [ ] Label as "help wanted" and "good first issue"

- [ ] Create "Integration with Cycle ORM" issue:
  - [ ] Describe integration goals
  - [ ] Share code examples
  - [ ] Label as "help wanted" and "good first issue"

## Step 3: Contact Communities (1 day)

- [ ] Laminas community:
  - [ ] Write on Laminas Slack: https://getlaminas.org/chat
  - [ ] Introduce the package and share GitHub issue link
  - [ ] Propose collaboration and ask for feedback

- [ ] Cycle ORM community:
  - [ ] Create an issue on Cycle ORM GitHub repository
  - [ ] Write on Discord: https://discord.gg/TFeEmCs
  - [ ] Introduce the package and propose integration

## Step 4: Create Example Projects (3-5 days)

- [ ] Laminas example project:
  - [ ] Create a simple Laminas MVC or Mezzio project
  - [ ] Integrate `responsive-sk/slim4-root`
  - [ ] Document steps and benefits
  - [ ] Upload to GitHub as `responsive-sk/laminas-root-example`

- [ ] Cycle ORM example project:
  - [ ] Create a simple project with Cycle ORM
  - [ ] Use `responsive-sk/slim4-root` for path management
  - [ ] Document steps and benefits
  - [ ] Upload to GitHub as `responsive-sk/cycle-root-example`

## Step 5: Sharing and Promotion (ongoing)

- [ ] Write a blog post:
  - [ ] "How to use responsive-sk/slim4-root with Laminas and Cycle ORM"
  - [ ] Share on dev.to, Medium, or your own blog

- [ ] Share on social media:
  - [ ] Twitter/X
  - [ ] LinkedIn
  - [ ] Facebook PHP groups
  - [ ] PHP forums and Reddit r/PHP

- [ ] Monitor feedback:
  - [ ] Respond to comments and questions
  - [ ] Implement suggested improvements

## Step 6: Long-term Collaboration (long-term goal)

- [ ] Propose official integration:
  - [ ] After receiving positive feedback, propose official integration
  - [ ] This could be in the form of a pull request to official repositories

- [ ] Participate in community events:
  - [ ] Present your package at PHP meetups or conferences
  - [ ] Share experiences and case studies

## Notes

- Prioritize steps based on available time and resources
- Start with extending documentation and creating example projects
- Be open to feedback and suggestions from the community
- Track metrics (downloads, GitHub stars, issues) to measure success
